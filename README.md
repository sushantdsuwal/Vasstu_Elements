# Vaastu Component

This little project is my humble attempt to make Cross-platform reusable Components and other resourses to head-start new React Native project.

## Tech ðŸ› 

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) via [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - web rendering and PWA functionality in one neat package
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - via [react-native init](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - JS navigation framework for the native app
- [React Native Extended StyleSheet](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet) - Drop-in replacement of React Native StyleSheet 
- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) - type checking to avoid unexpected glitches.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - state container.
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - Persist and rehydrate a redux store.

## Watch out the bugs

This code is still messy!
